<h1> Answers</h1>
<p> <a id="guarantee"></a>Do you offer guarantees?  All work produced by C. Thompson Photography is guaranteed.  If for any reason you aren’t happy with images from your session a reshoot will be offered.  I believe in 100% customer satisfaction and I want you to love your portraits and the story they tell</p>

<br>
<br>

<p> <a id="location"></a>Where will session take place? Sessions can take place anywhere ample natural light is available.  I want your pictures to accurately reflect you so together we will choose a site where you can feel comfortable and be yourself, this way I can capture who you are.</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<br>
<br>

<p> <a id="length"></a>How long do sessions take? A typical session will last anywhere from 60-90 minutes.  Newborn sessions will vary and can take up to 3 hours. </p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<br>
<br>

<p> <a id="retainer"></a>Is the session retainer due at booking &amp; what does it cover?
    Yes, there is a non-refundable retainer; it is due at the appointment booking.  This fee does include a pre-session consultation, on-location shooting and 30 soft proofed images for previewing.  The retainer fee covers a photography session for up to 5 individuals.  Each additional individual is $15.  This does not include any prints or digital files.
</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="after"></a>What happens after my session?
    During your consultation, we will determine if you want to view your images via an on-line gallery or if you’d prefer an in-home image viewing/ordering presentation.  Within 7-10 days of your session you will either be scheduled for the presentation or I will email you a password-protected gallery link, where you will be able to view your images and place an order.  If you choose to view and order your images on-line, the secure gallery will only remain active for 5 business days.  If for some reason you need to have the link reactivated there will be a $25 fee.  The gallery link may be shared with family and friends so that they may view your images and place and order if they choose.  Payment is due in full once your order has been submitted.  You can expect to receive your prints and/or digital files within 2-4 weeks of ordering.  Delivery time for weddings and custom services may differ.

</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="payment"></a>What form of payment do you accept?
    I accept check, cash, PayPal and most major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discover &amp; Amex).
</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="custom"></a>Do you provide custom products?
    Of course, I will try!  Contact me with what you have in mind.  Specialty items such as framed prints metal prints; image boxes, books &amp; non-standard print sizes are available.  Custom products are subject to an additional design fee.

</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="wear"></a>What do I need to wear?
    I want my clients to feel comfortable and their portraits to reflect who they are, so if you are a flip-flop and jeans person that is what you should wear, if you are a heels and skirt person then wear that.  Please keep in mind that we will more than likely be shooting outdoors.  We can get the wardrobe details ironed out at the consultation.  Don’t sweat the wardrobe- be yourself.
</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="props"></a>Do you allow clothing changes &amp; props?
    Yes, both are allowed.  We will discuss these details in your pre-session consultation.  Some locations will have facilities for clothing changes, whereas other will not and will require some creative improvising.
</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="travel"></a>Do you travel?
    I am willing to travel within a 40-mile radius of the greater Austin area (78634 zip code).  For all other areas, and additional mileage charge based on the current mileage rate published by the IRS is required.

</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="weather"></a>What if the weather is uncooperative?
    Since a majority of my sessions are outdoors, it is key for us to utilize the very best natural light to create your portraits.  In the event of inclement weather 9most likely rain, fog, or extremely overcast skies) prevents a scheduled session, I will contact you as soon as possible so we can get you rescheduled as soon as possible.  The session retainer fee will be transferred to your new session date.
</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="cancellations"></a>What about cancellations?
    Being a mom of 3 children, I realize that things unexpectedly come up that require a cancellation.  If possible, a 24-hour notice is greatly appreciated.  If a cancellation is required, the session will be canceled and rescheduled.  The session retainer will not be refunded.
</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="invest"></a>What can I expect to invest?
    I offer an array of products and packages designed to fit any budget.  You have the option of purchasing digital packages, traditional print packages &amp; a la carte prints.  

</p> 
<a href="#top">Back to Questions</a>

<p> <a id="plan"></a>Do you offer payment plans?
    I do offer payment plans for weddings and any purchases exceeding $1,500.
